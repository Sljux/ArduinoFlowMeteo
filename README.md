# Real Time End-To-End With Arduino, FlowThings and Angular

Code for a [tutorial](http://cityos.io/member.tutorial/986) about building end-to-end real time computing systems.
It is a step-by-step demonstration of how to build a simple Arduino based meteorological station, that sends
sensor readings to a FlowThings server. The server augments recieved readings with data from a third party
weather API, and broadcasts the data to all subscribed clients. A simple Node/Angular app is used as an
example of the client.
